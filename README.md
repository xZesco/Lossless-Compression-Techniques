# Lossless Compression Techniques

This project demonstrates various lossless compression techniques implemented in Python, including Run-Length Encoding, Huffman Encoding, Arithmetic Encoding, Golomb Encoding, and LZW Encoding. It also includes a GUI application for demonstrating these techniques interactively.

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/youssef00mohamed/Lossless-Compression-Techniques
cd Lossless-Compression-Techniques
```

**Install Dependencies**: Install the required libraries and dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Compression Algorithms Project

## Project Overview
This project consists of two main components:

1. **Compression Algorithms**: Implemented in Python, these algorithms are designed to compress data efficiently using various encoding methods.

2. **GUI Application**: A graphical user interface built with Tkinter that allows users to input text and visualize the results of different compression algorithms.

## Directory Structure
- `compression_algorithms/`: Contains Python files implementing different compression algorithms.
- `compression/`: Contains the GUI application built with Tkinter for interactive compression demonstrations.

## Usage Instructions

1. **Run the GUI Application
```bash
python compression/main.py
```

2. **Input Text**: Enter the text you want to compress in the provided text area.
   
3. **View Results**: The application displays compression ratios, encoded values, and other metrics for each selected compression method.

4. **Message Box**: The application displays if the text is not compatible with any of the compression techniques and also:

- Error Handling: If there are any errors during compression or input handling, the application will display an error message using a message box.
- Information Display: Important information, such as compression results or warnings, are also shown using message boxes for clear user feedback.

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have suggestions for improvements, additional compression algorithms, or enhancements to the GUI application, please feel free to open an issue or pull request. Ensure that your contributions align with the project's objectives and maintain code quality and documentation standards.
